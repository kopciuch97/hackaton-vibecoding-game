# HACKATHON PROJECT: "Boldare Run: Sprint to MVP"
**Goal:** A browser-based 2D endless runner built in 4 hours.
**Tech:** HTML5 Canvas + Vanilla JS. Single file architecture prefered for MVP.

## THEME: "The Boldare Way"
- **Player:** A Boldare Developer/Product Designer (abstract representation first).
- **Goal:** Run as far as possible in the "Sprint".
- **Obstacles:** "Legacy Code", "Bugs", "Blockers".
- **Collectibles:** "Insights", "Feedback".
- **Visual Style:** Boldare Brand Colors (Orange #FFA500, Black #111, White #FFF). Clean, minimalist, agile.

## CODING GUIDELINES (FOR CLAUDE CODE CLI)
- **Files:** Keep logic in `game.js`, structure in `index.html`, styles in `style.css`.
- **Method:** Iterative. Do not break existing features.
- **Error Handling:** If I report a bug, analyze the file content before fixing.
- **Graphics:** Use Canvas primitives (rects/circles) first. Later generate SVG strings.
